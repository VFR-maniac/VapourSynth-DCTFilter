Usage:

dct.Filter(clip clip, float factors[8])

Performs DCT on 8x8 blocks of source clip, applies modification to it, then performs IDCT.
Modification is done as following: dct(x, y) = dct(x, y) * factor[x] * factor[y]

This filter does essentially the same as original Tom Barry's DctFilter for AviSynth, but does it differently.
All calculations are done on floating point values, and factors are applied as they are, not rounded.
Thus, the accuracy is higher.

Padding to mod8 is automatic for every plane, but cropping to non-mod16 values before applying this filter is impractical and shouldn't be done.
